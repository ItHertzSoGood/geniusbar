# Diagnosing a broken tweak:

Lets get started. If you have a tweak breaking an app or you cannot jailbreak, launched into safe mode every respring, or something like that, this guide is ideal.  

1.) Jailbreak into `Safe Mode` (checkra1n) or with `Load Tweaks` disabled (unc0ver). This should allow you to boot into a jailbroken state without your tweaks injecting, hopefully fixing any issues you may have.  

2.) Open your package manager of choice and add https://ib-soft.net/cydia/ to your sources, refresh your sources and install the iCleaner Pro package. After respringing, you should see an icon on your home screen for iCleaner Pro.  

3.) Click the + icon on the left of your screen, click Cydia Substrate Addons, and disable half of the tweaks with a blue ticker. DO NOT DISABLE ORANGE OR RED TICKERS.

4.) Re-jailbreak with `Load Tweaks` enabled or `Safe Mode` disabled and see if the issue is fixed. If the issue stops, you know the faulty tweak is in the half that you disabled. If the issue persists, the faulty tweak is in the half you didn't disable.

5.) Half the half that you know has the faulty tweak in it.

6.) Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the tweak is found. Remove the tweak and enable the rest.
