# Diagnosing a broken tweak:

If you have a tweak breaking an app or you cannot jailbreak, launched into safe mode every respring, or find that your device is randomly respringing, this guide is ideal.  

1.) Jailbreak into `Safe Mode` (checkra1n) or with `Load Tweaks` disabled (unc0ver). This should allow you to boot into a jailbroken state without your tweaks injecting, hopefully fixing any issues you may have.  

2.) Open your package manager of choice, add `https://ib-soft.net/cydia/` to your sources and refresh your sources.

3.) Install the iCleaner Pro package. After a respring, you should see an icon on your home screen for iCleaner Pro.  

4.) Click the `+` icon on the left of your screen, click `Cydia Substrate Addons`.

5.) Disable all of the tweaks with a blue ticker. DO NOT DISABLE ORANGE OR RED TICKERS.

6.) Re-jailbreak your device without `Safe Mode` (checkra1n) or `Load Tweaks` disabled (unc0ver).

7.) One at a time, re-enable tweaks in iCleaner Pro and respring.

8.) Repeat this process until you re-enable the conflicting tweak.

9.) Uninstall the conflicting tweak using your package manager of choice.
