# ametrinedev/geniusbar
Images and text made by myself (@quiprr) and @Dudeamax99 (Send a PR if you wish!) to help us help you in the Genius Bar of the r/Jailbreak discord server.

## Directory
geniusbar/blank - Blank images used as presets before the arrows were attached  
geniusbar/pasteboard - Text documents with common issues and their solutions  
geniusbar/png - Images post-photoshop with arrows attached  
geniusbar/psd - PSD files for the final images  
geniusbar/scripts - Scripts to install/fix random stuff  
ametrine.dev - Site and repo to serve said scripts and maybe tweaks in the future  

## Updates to come / Goals
- [x] geniusbar/fixes - Tweaks to fix or execute common tasks with the push of a button (CC/Activator integration?)  
- [x] geniusbar/guides - Written guides rather than quick fixes for certain issues/tweaks (ReProvision, AltStore, etc.)  
- [x] geniusbar/repo - Repository to host geniusbar/fixes and potentially future personal tweaks, though this may change  
- [x] ItHertzSoGood/ithertzsogood.github.io - GitHub Pages site to act as the frontend host of the repository
- [ ] geniusbar/bot (???) - Discord bot to act as a host for fixes, activated by Geniusesâ„¢ using a set of commands and automatically sending a message with said fix
