If using unc0ver:
First, navigate to the unc0ver app and click the gear icon.
Uncheck the 'Disable Auto Updates' box and check the 'Restore RootFS' box.
If it doesn't work after that, re-jailbreak and download iCleaner Pro.
Click the plus in the bottom left, click 'Launch Daemons', and make sure the OTA update daemon is enabled.
Restore RootFS again, ensuring 'Disable Auto Updates' is still unchecked.
If all else fails, do a system restore.

If using checkra1n:
Download iCleaner Pro and make sure the OTA update daemon is enabled.
Navigate to the checkra1n Loader app and click 'Restore System'.
If that doesn't work, do a system restore.
