# Disabling OTA updates with your jailbreak

For unc0ver users:  
1.) Figure out what version of unc0ver you are running. If it is v5.0.0 or v5.0.1 (fixed in v5.2.0!), turn on the `Disable Auto Updates` ticker in the settings and re-jailbreak.  
2.) If that doesn't work, add https://ib-soft.net/cydia/ to your sources in Cydia/Sileo/Zebra/Installer and install iCleaner Pro.  
3.) Go to the iCleaner Pro app, click the + on the bottom left, click `Launch Daemons`, and turn off the OTA update daemon.  
4.) Press apply. If your settings app hangs when pressing the software update button, you have successfully disabled OTA updates.
